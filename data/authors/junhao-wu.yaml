    summary: "Contributed to a multimodal deepfake detection system that fuses semantic, frequency-domain, and spatial-domain features for social platform content moderation and evidence extraction. Worked with 100K+ data samples across multiple modalities; incorporated CLIP-based semantic features, a frequency-branch module (Freq-Net), and a spatial-branch module (CameraPrint), and applied mutual-consistency constraints and contrastive learning to improve fusion. Achieved 0.97 AUC on the validation set and 93%+ accuracy, delivering ~8 percentage-point improvement over a baseline model; explored lightweight deployment strategies."
