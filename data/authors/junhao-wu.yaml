bio: "I am an **undergraduate CS student** at Dalian University of Technology. My research interests focus on **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** and **robot manipulation**, with an emphasis on robustness and self-supervised learning under distribution shifts. I led work on improving zero-shot generalization for VLA models and contributed to open-vocabulary person re-identification; both are currently under submission to **ICML 2026**. I also led the development of **MindCare**, a multimodal mental-health assessment system, and worked on robust multimodal forgery detection during an algorithm internship. I aim to develop reproducible, scalable methods that improve the reliability and generalization of VLA models in real-world settings.

    summary: "We systematically analyzed the performance degradation of OpenVLA under **visual distribution shifts** and attributed it to environmental perturbations in visual representations. Based on this insight, we developed **a self-supervised training framework** for the vision encoder, introducing **a small number of learnable prompt tokens** optimized with **a redundancy-reduction objective**. Without requiring target-domain data or language model updates, the method effectively enhances visual invariance. Experiments on LIBERO-plus demonstrate consistent robustness improvements under **lighting, layout, and background shifts**, along with **strong zero-shot generalization capability**.
